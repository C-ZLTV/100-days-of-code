# I've decided to join the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

This is going to be a journey with its bright and dark moments, as it should be. Learning new skills, especially those that, not only requires consistent practice but also many brain cells are especially challenging and coding is one of them.

Consistency hasn't always been my strong suit but I've been working on being better with it and am now confident enough to take on this challenge without burning myself out and feeling overwhelmed.

After all, coding has always been my true but hidden passion. My strong motivation is to build a better life and future for myself by doing something that I've always enjoyed but never really taken under serious consideration.
