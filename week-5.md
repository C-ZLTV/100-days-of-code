### Day 29: February 27, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today I learned about asynchronous JS and how to create asynchronous functions. Looked over callback hell, promises, async and await.

Mostly practiced fetch to get data from an API.

**THOUGHTS**: It's the first time I got to learn and practice asynchronous JS and it was like discovering a whole another side of JS that I was completely unaware about.

The concepts are not difficult to grasp but coding asynchronous stuff seems really tricky. I still need to get the hang of it but I'm feeling good about it since it's just been one day.

### Day 30: February 28, 2023 (TUESDAY)

##### PROMISES AND ASYNC/AWAIT

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practice a somewhat more advance use of promises, the highlights are:

- get all cat names from a cat API
- find the 10 largest countries from a countries API
- find the total number of official languages from a countries API

**THOUGHTS**: Today has been successful and I'm feeling good. I felt challenged by today's practice and am grateful I managed to complete it. Finally got to work with APIs, something that I had to Google multiple times in the past because I couldn't understand them at all.
