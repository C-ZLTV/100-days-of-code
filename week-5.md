### Day 29: February 27, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today I learned about asynchronous JS and how to create asynchronous functions. Looked over callback hell, promises, async and await.

Mostly practiced fetch to get data from an API.

**THOUGHTS**: It's the first time I got to learn and practice asynchronous JS and it was like discovering a whole another side of JS that I was completely unaware about.

The concepts are not difficult to grasp but coding asynchronous stuff seems really tricky. I still need to get the hang of it but I'm feeling good about it since it's just been one day.

### Day 30: February 28, 2023 (TUESDAY)

##### PROMISES AND ASYNC/AWAIT

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practice a somewhat more advance use of promises, the highlights are:

- get all cat names from a cat API
- find the 10 largest countries from a countries API
- find the total number of official languages from a countries API

**THOUGHTS**: Today has been successful and I'm feeling good. I felt challenged by today's practice and am grateful I managed to complete it. Finally got to work with APIs, something that I had to Google multiple times in the past because I couldn't understand them at all.

### Day 31: March 1, 2023 (WEDNESDAY)

##### CLOSURES

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practiced closures by rewriting inner functions into a previous complex function.

**THOUGHTS**: Learning about closures cleared up some things for me and help me understand some pieces of code that were a bit unclear before. Really glad I showed up today even with so little sleep in my body.

In tomorrow I will start working with DOM and I'm actually excited about it since I will be able to create my own small projects soon!

Also I miss CSS, kinda like it.
