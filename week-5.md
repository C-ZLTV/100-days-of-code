### Day 29: February 27, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today I learned about asynchronous JS and how to create asynchronous functions. Looked over callback hell, promises, async and await.

Mostly practiced fetch to get data from an API.

**THOUGHTS**: It's the first time I got to learn and practice asynchronous JS and it was like discovering a whole another side of JS that I was completely unaware about.

The concepts are not difficult to grasp but coding asynchronous stuff seems really tricky. I still need to get the hang of it but I'm feeling good about it since it's just been one day.
