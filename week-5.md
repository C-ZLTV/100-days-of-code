### Day 29: February 27, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today I learned about asynchronous JS and how to create asynchronous functions. Looked over callback hell, promises, async and await.

Mostly practiced fetch to get data from an API.

**THOUGHTS**: It's the first time I got to learn and practice asynchronous JS and it was like discovering a whole another side of JS that I was completely unaware about.

The concepts are not difficult to grasp but coding asynchronous stuff seems really tricky. I still need to get the hang of it but I'm feeling good about it since it's just been one day.

### Day 30: February 28, 2023 (TUESDAY)

##### PROMISES AND ASYNC/AWAIT

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practice a somewhat more advance use of promises, the highlights are:

- get all cat names from a cat API
- find the 10 largest countries from a countries API
- find the total number of official languages from a countries API

**THOUGHTS**: Today has been successful and I'm feeling good. I felt challenged by today's practice and am grateful I managed to complete it. Finally got to work with APIs, something that I had to Google multiple times in the past because I couldn't understand them at all.

### Day 31: March 1, 2023 (WEDNESDAY)

##### CLOSURES

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practiced closures by rewriting inner functions into a previous complex function.

**THOUGHTS**: Learning about closures cleared up some things for me and help me understand some pieces of code that were a bit unclear before. Really glad I showed up today even with so little sleep in my body.

In tomorrow I will start working with DOM and I'm actually excited about it since I will be able to create my own small projects soon!

Also I miss CSS, kinda like it.

### Day 32: March 2, 2023 (THURSDAY)

##### CLEAN CODE

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Learned about style guides and which are the most popular ones. Also some general coding conventions.

**THOUGHTS**: For now I will not follow any particular style guide because I'm still learning. Once I will find a job I will have to comply with my team's style guide anyways.

### Day 33: March 3, 2023 (FRIDAY)

##### DOM

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Learned about DOM and how to access and manipulate it.

**THOUGHTS**: It's to be finally able to interact with CSS anf HTML from JS

### Day 34: March 4, 2023 (SATURDAY)

##### DATA STRUCTURES

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Learned about the most common data structures and how thy work.

**THOUGHTS**: Was kinda interested about in the topic for quite some time but I just couldn't get a hang of it. Now that I've managed arrays, array-like structures and object I finally understood what are data structures about.

### Day 35: March 5, 2023 (SUNDAY)

##### DATA STRUCTURES

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Looked over data structures a bit more just fro fun.

**THOUGHTS**: I'd love to get into the specifics and really master the topic but I'd like to avoid such a time consuming trajectory in my learning process right now.
