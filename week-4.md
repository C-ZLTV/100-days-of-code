##### CONSOLE OBJECTS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practiced console object methods. Worked with console.warn(), console.error(), console.table(), console.time(), console.info(), console.assert(). The most interesting thing was calculating the speed of all the different loops.

**THOUGHTS**: Didn't feel particularly motivated today but the challenged kind of forced me to at least start the things I had planned for the day and ended up completing everything.

### Day 26: February 24, 2023 (SUNDAY)

##### ERROR HANDLING AND CLASSES

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Learned about the most common types or errors and how to handle them. Was also able to finally deal with classes and practice them.

**THOUGHTS**: I'm glad I finally saw classes today and got to complete some exercises with them. I was a bit confused at first since I've previously learnt about object constructor in other guides and didn't understand the difference.

##### OFF DAY

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Off day

### Day 28: February 26, 2023 (SUNDAY)

##### JSON AND WEB STORAGES

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practiced JSON methods and how to deal with JSON in general. Also looked and different ways to storage data on client side and practiced localStorage methods.

**THOUGHTS**: Can't believe week four is already over. I felt a bit off this week since there are still so many things to learn. It kinda makes me feel like I will never be able to know things well enough.
