##### FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practiced console object methods. Worked with console.warn(), console.error(), console.table(), console.time(), console.info(), console.assert(). The most interesting thing was calculating the speed of all the different loops.

**THOUGHTS**: Didn't feel particularly motivated today but the challenged kind of forced me to at least start the things I had planned for the day and ended up completing everything.
