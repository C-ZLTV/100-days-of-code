# WEEK 1 - Logs

### Day 1: January 30, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### JS: SOME METHODS

**Today's Progress**: Did plenty of Math Object and String Methods exercises.

**Thoughts:** I gained new prospective on some string methods. They are not that difficult to understand or to use in simple code but I guess the hard part comes from trying to combine them together in an efficient and actually meaningful way.

I will keep practising until I will gain a deeper understanding on how things work since util now I have been focusing on reading JS guides and what not.

I'm currently using the [30 Days of JS repository](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript) for the exercises.

### Day 2: January 31, 2023 (TUESDAY)

##### DATES AND WINDOW METHODS

**Today's Progress**: Completed a massive amount of exercises on Dates, Window Methods, Comparisons and Logical Operators.

**Thoughts**: Strengthened my knowledge on some tricky JS comparisons that I probably put too much effort into
studying. I'm still glad I did, since I feel like I understand things better and quicker this way.

I finally properly understood dates. The new Date() vs Date.now() was confusing to me up until today but with some practice I now know how they work and how they are different.

Also lessons of the day:

- Use const unless you have a good reason to use let.
- Use === unless you have a very good reason to use ==.

[This](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/) is an extremely detailed comparison of data types that I will go back to from time to time.
