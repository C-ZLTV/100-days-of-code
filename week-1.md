# WEEK 1- Logs

##### JS: SOME METHODS

**Today's Progress**: Did plenty of Math Object and String Methods exercises.

**Thoughts:** I gained new prospective on some string methods. They are not that difficult to understand or to use in simple code but I guess the hard part comes from trying to combine them together in an efficient and actually meaningful way. I will keep practising until I will gain a deeper understanding on how things work since util now I have been focusing on reading JS guides and what not.
