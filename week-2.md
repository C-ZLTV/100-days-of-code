##### ARRAY LOOPS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today I worked mostly with for...of. Completed multiple exercises:

- returned an array of strings that contain a certain substring from an initial array of strings

- created, accessed, and worked with nested array element

- map and filter methods

**THOUGHTS**: During today's practice I felt much more confident working with loops, especially for...of.

I think my understanding of loops and my capacity to work with them unblocked, since I can do stuff faster and on my own.
