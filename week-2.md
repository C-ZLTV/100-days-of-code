### Day 8: February 06, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### ARRAY LOOPS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today I worked mostly with for...of. Completed multiple exercises:

- returned an array of strings that contain a certain substring from an initial array of strings

- created, accessed, and worked with nested array element

- map and filter methods

**THOUGHTS**: During today's practice I felt much more confident working with loops, especially for...of.

I think my understanding of loops and my capacity to work with them unblocked, since I can do stuff faster and on my own.

##### BREAK DAY

### Day 10: February 08, 2023 (WEDNESDAY)

##### FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Worked with all types of function syntax: function declaration, function expressions and arrow functions.

Also combined functions with loops to create various results like modified arrays and sums with specific parameters.

**THOUGHTS**: There were some things that I needed to look up and follow examples in order to understand the process but once I did things were much more clear.

I imagine there is no need and it's quite impossible to know or remember everything off the top of my head, especially now.
