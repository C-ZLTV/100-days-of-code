### Day 8: February 06, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### ARRAY LOOPS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today I worked mostly with for...of. Completed multiple exercises:

- returned an array of strings that contain a certain substring from an initial array of strings

- created, accessed, and worked with nested array element

- map and filter methods

**THOUGHTS**: During today's practice I felt much more confident working with loops, especially for...of.

I think my understanding of loops and my capacity to work with them unblocked, since I can do stuff faster and on my own.

### Day 9: February 07, 2023 (TUESDAY)

##### BREAK DAY

### Day 10: February 08, 2023 (WEDNESDAY)

##### FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Worked with all types of function syntax: function declaration, function expressions and arrow functions.

Also combined functions with loops to create various results like modified arrays and sums with specific parameters.

**THOUGHTS**: There were some things that I needed to look up and follow examples in order to understand the process but once I did things were much more clear.

I imagine there is no need and it's quite impossible to know or remember everything off the top of my head, especially now.

### Day 11: February 09, 2023 (THURSDAY)

##### FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today has been a rewarding day. Completed a plethora of functions and loop exercises. Some include:

- Random user IP and Mac Address generators

- User ID generated by User with ID length prompt

- Hex to RGB convertor

**THOUGHTS**:

### Day 12: February 10, 2023 (FRIDAY)

##### FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Some of today's functions were:

- Generates factorial of a number
- Checks if a parameter is empty
- Sums any number of arguments
- Modifies an item of an array
- Checks if all items in an array are unique
- Generates an array of random and unique numbers

**THOUGHTS**: Today's practice has been challenges, especially when it comes to working with unique values in arrays. Some things seem easy at first but then they get into some JS implications that tend to complicate the tasks.

I'm grateful of the progress I made today and can't for to finish up with functions and start objects tomorrow.
