### Day 15: February 13, 2023 (MONDAY)

##### OBJECTS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Today was thrilling! I got into the nitty gritty of working with objects in JS. Created multiple methods, some of the highlights:

- totalIncome, totalExpense, accountInfo, addIncome, addExpense and accountBalance methods for a personAccount Object

- signUp function that adds a new user object to an existing array of users (with randomized id and date-time of sign up)

- averageRating of product in products array

**THOUGHTS**: Today I got through my exercises fairly quickly but still feel slow overall.

I wish I could get things done faster but at the same time, I understand that being superficial in these first stages of learning won't help me in the long run.

What motivates me most is seeing how much progress I made compared to so little ago.

### Day 16: February 14, 2023 (TUESDAY)

##### HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Finally got to practice higher order functions and understood what a callback function is.

Mostly worked with forEach, map, filter, reduce, find, every, some, and sort.

### Day 17: February 15, 2023 (WEDNESDAY)

##### HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Worked with higher order functions again and it was really challenging. I managed to complete some practice exercises:

- Find total price from an array of products objects.

- Function that categorizes array of country Object by name, capital and population.

- Function that returns an array of objects with all the first letters and the number of times they appear in the array.

- Find the most used letter

**THOUGHTS**: Today I got really stuck. I am suppose to find the most spoken languages form an array of objects. I think I know how to do it but I still have no idea how to code it. Hopefully tomorrow I will get this done.

### Day 18: February 16, 2023 (THURSDAY)

##### HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practiced reduce() and other higher order functions all day long but still didn’t get to solve the problem I’m stuck on.

**THOUGHTS**: Today was kind of exhausting. Taking a break until tomorrow.

### Day 19: February 17, 2023 (FRIDAY)

##### HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Obsessively tried to solve the problem that I’ve been stuck on for the last 2 days. Got to a good enough point to call it a day.

**THOUGHTS**: JavaScript made me sob for the first time. I’m marking the date lol

### Day 20: February 18, 2023 (SATURDAY)

##### SETS AND MAPS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Understood how set and maps work and the differences between sets/arrays and maps/objects

**THOUGHTS**: Today felt like I needed a bit of a break, so decided to take it easy.

### Day 21: February 19, 2023 (SUNDAY)

##### MAPS AND SETS

**TODAY'S PROGRESS**: Practiced advanced use of maps and sets. Started practicing array and object destructuring. It’s an interesting concept so far.

**THOUGHTS**: Week 3 of daily coding is officially over. I couldn’t feel more grateful and fulfilled.
